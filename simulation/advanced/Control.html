                    In previous sections, we have learnt the basic skills to create a simulation using Matlab/Octave. Now,
                    we will use these skills to implement our own controller. In this section, we use the PID controller
                    as an example.

                    PID control stands for the Proportional-Integral-Derivative control. We can read from its name that
                    it consists of three parts, i.e., the proportional, integral, and derivative control. The following
                    figure shows the structure of a system controlled by a PID controller.

                    The usefulness of PID controls lies in their general feasibility to most control systems. In particular, 
                    PID controls prove to be most useful when the mathematical model of the plant is unknown. 
                    In the field of process control systems, it is well known that the 
                    basic and modified PID control schemes have proved their usefulness in providing satisfactory control, 
                    although in many given situations they may not provide optimal control.There are many variants of PID 
                    controller, such as P controller, PI controller, and PD controller.
                    <br><br>
                    As mentioned before, the PID controller consists of three parts and it can be depicted by the following form.
                    
                    $$u(t)=K_pe(t)+K_i\int e(t)dt+K_d\frac{de(t)}{dt}$$

                    Each part has a gain parameter, denoted by
                    $K_p$ for proportional, $K_i$ for integral, and $K_d$ for derivative, respectively. The performance of the PID
                    controller is governed by these three gain parameters.
                    <br><br>
                    Larger $K_p$ usaully leads to faster response since the larger the error, the larger the proportional term 
                    compensation. However, an excessively large $K_p$ could cause the instability and oscillation.
                    <br><br>
                    The integral part is usually used for the elimination of offset caused by disturbance, etc.
                    <br><br>
                    The derivative part can mitigate the overshoot and stability problem arised from a proportional controller with a high gain.
                    <br><br>
                    The following table presents the characteristics of different part of the PID controller.

                        Implementation of PID Controller
                    </h4>
                    <hr>
                    In the previous section, we discussed the basic knowledge of the PID controller. Now, let's see how to
                    implement a PID controller in Matlab/Octave. Basicly, there are two types of implementation, which are
                    the continuous method and the discrete method.
                    <br><br>
                    First, let's learn the continuous way to implement a PID controller.
                    </br></br>
                    <h5>
                        Transfer Function
                    </h5>
                    As mentioned in previous section, a common way to represent the system is the transfer function. Similarly,
                    we can also calculate the transfer function of the PID controller by simple Laplace transformation.
                    The transfer function in the Laplace domain of the PID controller is

                    $$
                    G_c=K_p+\frac{K_i}{s}+K_ds
                    $$

                    The block diagram of the closed-loop system with a PID controller looks like:
                    <br><br>
                    <div class="col-12 col-xl">
                        <pre>
                        <img src="pic/pid_trans.jpg" width="500" height="150">
                        </pre>
                    </div>
                    By using the knowledge we learnt in the Sec. Systems Modeling, we can easily obtain the transfer
                    function of the closed-loop system. Then, utilize the knowledge we learnt in Sec. Systems Analysis,
                    we can examine the time response of the closed-loop system with the PID controller. Now, we finally
                    implement the PID controller in a continuous way.

                    <br><br>
                    However, to implement the PID controller to a real systems, such as robots, we usually need to design
                    it in a discrete way. Now, let's consider the implementation of PID controller in a discrete way.
                    <br><br>
                    There are many methods to implement the discrete PID controller. In this section, we discuss two of them, which
                    are most commonly used.
                    </br></br>
                    <h5>
                        Positional PID Control
                    </h5>
                    Positional PID is an approximation of the analog PID. For this algorithm, we use a series of sampling time poins
                    to replace the continuous time, use the summation to approximate the integration, and use the difference equation to 
                    approximate the differential. The approximations are as follows:

                    $$
                    \left\{\begin{aligned}
                    & t=kT, k=0,1,2,\dots\\
                    & \int_0^te(t)dt\approx T\sum_{j=0}^ke(j)\\
                    & \frac{de(t)}{dt}\approx\frac{e(k)-e(k-1)}{T}
                    \end{aligned}\right.
                    $$

                    where $T$ is the sampling period, $e(k)=e(kT)$. Therefore, we can obtain the discrete PID controller as 
                    the following form:

                    $$
                    u(k)=K_pe(k)+k_iT\sum_{j=0}^ke(j)+K_d\frac{e(k)-e(k-1)}{T}
                    $$

                    <h5>
                        Incremental PID Control
                    </h5>
                    The incremental PID control can be derived from the positional PID control. We define a control increment

                    $$
                    \Delta u(k)=u(k)-u(k-1)
                    $$

                    Using the controller we derived in the positional PID control, we can obtain the incremental PID controller

                    $$
                    \Delta u(k)=K_p(e(k)-e(k-1))+K_iTe(k)+K_d\frac{e(k)-2e(k-1)+e(k-2)}{T}
                    $$

                    We accumulatively sum the control increment to update the PID controller. Compared with the positional PID
                    controller, the incremental PID controller doesn't require to record the errors at all steps and only involves
                    the current error and the errors at the last two steps.
                    <br><br>
                    <h5>
                        Parameter Tuning
                    </h5>
                    One key to implement the PID controller well is the tuning of the three gain parameters. However, tuning the parameters
                    is usually empirical and there's no formal analytical ways to do it. Many methods have been developed to faciliate the
                    parameters tuning. Here, we present a most commonly used method.
                    <br><br>
                    The basic routine is shown in the following table.
                    <br><br>
                    <div class="col-12 col-xl">
                        <pre>
                        <img src="pic/tuning.jpg" width="500" height="300">
                        </pre>
                    </div>
                    1. At the beginning, set all gains to zero.
                    <br>
                    2. Increase the P gain until the response to a disturbance is steady oscillation.
                    <br>
                    3. Increase the D gain until the oscillations go away (i.e. it's critically damped).
                    <br>
                    4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until increasing the D gain does not stop the oscillations.
                    <br>
                    5. Set P and D to the last stable values.
                    <br>
                    6. Increase the I gain until it brings you to the setpoint with the number of
                    oscillations desired (normally zero. otherwise a quicker response can be
                    obtained if you don't mind a couple oscillations of overshoot)
                    <br><br>
                    <h5>
                        Example
                    </h5>
                    Now let us use an example to see how the implementation of PID controller works. Consider a system with
                    the following transfer function:
                    $$
                    G(s)=\frac{523500}{s^3+87.35s^2+10470s}
                    $$

                    Now, we design a PID controller in the form of transfer function to drive the system to track a step signal with amplitude of 1. Create
                    a new m file and type the following script in it, then run the script and you can obtain the simulation
                    result.
                    <div class="codeClass">
